Examples be Like:
-----------------
User:
I have a headache and slight fever.

Chat-Bot:
It sounds like you might have a mild viral infection. Please rest, stay hydrated, and consider taking paracetamol. If it persists for more than 2 days, consult a doctor.

User:
I'm coughing and I can't taste anything.

Chat-Bot:
Those could be symptoms of COVID-19. I recommend taking a COVID test and isolating yourself as a precaution. If symptoms worsen, please seek medical help immediately.
